TO START KAFKA YOU NEED TO START ZOOKEEPER SERVICE
on kafka path launch cmd ===========> C:\Users\U480401\Documents\kafka

2- .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

KAFKA IS A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM IT ACTS AS CLUSTER = IS A SET OF BROKES ( MIN 3 )

IF PRODUCERS ARE SENDING DATA, THEY MUST BE SENDING IT TO SOMEONE. THE CONSUMERS ARE THE RECEIPIENTS.
BUT PRODUCERS SEND DATA ONLY TO KAFKA SERVER. AND ANYONE WHO IS INTRESTED IN THAT DATA CAN COME FORWARD AND TAKE IT FROM KAFKA SERVER


===+>  TOPICS
WHEN THE CONSUMER ASKS DATA FROM KAFKA, WHICH DATA DOES HE WANT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME IDENTIFICATION MECHANISM TO REQUEST DATA
FROM A BROKER. THERE COME THE NOTION OF THE TOPIC
1- HE IS LIKE TABLE IN DATABASE OR FOLDER IN FILE SYSTEM.
2- TOPIC IS IDENTIFIED BY NAME.
3- YOU CAN HAVE ANY NUMBER OF TOPICS

====> PARTITIONS
KAFKA TOPICS ARE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF PARTTIONS, WHICH CONTAINS RECORDS IN AN UNCHANGEABLE SEQUENCE.
KAFKA WILL STOERS MESSAGES FOR A TOPIC. BUT THE CAPACITY OF DATA CAN ENOURMOUS AND IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO STORE IN A SINGLE COMPUTER.
THEREFORE IT WILL BE PARTITIONED INTO MULTIPLE PARTS AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG MULTIPLE COMPUTERS, SINCE KAFKA IS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM.

=====> OFFSETS ---> MESSAGE ID.
IS A ASEQUENCE OF IDS GIVEN TO MESSAGES AS THEY ARRIVE AT A PARTITION.
ONCE OFFSET IS ASSIGNED IT CAN NEVER BE CHANGED.
THE FIRST MESSAGE GETS THE OFFSET 0 AND INCREMENTED BY 1.
